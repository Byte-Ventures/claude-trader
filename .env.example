# RSI - Momentum oscillator (0-100)
RSI_PERIOD=14              # Lookback period (lower = more responsive)
RSI_OVERSOLD=35            # Below this = buy zone (default: 35, aggressive: 40)

ATR_PERIOD=14              # Volatility lookback period

# Signal Threshold - Minimum score to execute trade
# Score range: -100 (strong sell) to +100 (strong buy)
# Threshold: 55 = balanced, 50 = more trades, 65 = fewer/higher quality trades
#
# v1.30.0 tuning rationale: Lowered from 60 to 55 because trend-aware sentiment
# modifiers now filter out bad trades (fear+bearish+buy), so we can afford
# a slightly lower threshold without catching falling knives.

# ==============================================================================
# CRASH PROTECTION
# ==============================================================================
